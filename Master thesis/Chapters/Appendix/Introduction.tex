\chapter{Implementation details}

This chapter will be devoted to themes that are related to the purpose of this work but that do not directly support it. This presents more technical aspects, which certainly have an impact on our conclusions, but which are a bit off. They remain important to notify in order to reproduce the experiences but less assiduous readers can stop reading here. We will start by detailing the hardware used in the experiments and then move on to the specific software used. Everything has been developed in C++-14, since this is the maximum version supported by CUDA 9.1.
