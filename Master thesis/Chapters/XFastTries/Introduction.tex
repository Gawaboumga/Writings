\chapter{X-Fast Tries}\label{XFastTrie}

When we leave the realm of data structures purely based on comparing keys, we may expect to reduce the complexity of several operations, in an analoguous manner than we can achieve linear complexity with counting sort for instance in $O(N + K)$ for integer values instead of the general lower bound $\Omega(N \log N)$ in comparison model. In this chapter, we will present a quite old data structure defined in word-RAM computation model and some of its variations.
