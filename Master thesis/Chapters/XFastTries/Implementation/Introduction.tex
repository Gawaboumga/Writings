After having seen the different concepts and perceived what we wanted to obtain, we can start to implement our problem in order to see what it really is, what the performance can be and if it can be really interesting. We will begin by discussing in more detail the X-fast tries\index{X-fast trie} themselves, with focus on the different possible implementations and their various advantages. We will follow by presenting the results we obtained in comparison to another data structure that proposes simular properties and which is widely used. We will end by giving the appropriate conclusions and the possibilities for improvement as well as the main interests and defects.

We first address them in the sequential framework, this will allow us to identify the main difficulties and implementation details. Once those work properly and we will start to see the first results, we will then be able to see what will be needed to adapt them to the concurrent framework.
