We have previously seen in detail the X-fast tries\index{X-fast trie}, their general concept and implementation strategy, in a sequential framework$^{[\ref{XFastTrie}]}$. We can try to adapt it better to the paradigm of graphic cards\index{Graphics cards} and thus take advantage of all the computing power offered by them. Indeed, our implementation was for the moment purely sequential\index{Sequential} in order to see if it presented only a theoretical or real interest. Following the results, we looked at the question of making this data structure concurrent\index{Concurrent} and since they are based on hash tables\index{Hash table}, it was interesting to come back to these different notions. In this chapter, we will attempt to combine these two aspects (the X-fast tries\index{X-fast trie} and concurrent\index{Concurrent} hash tables\index{Hash table}) into one to see what could be achieved for more exploitable purposes. This will also allow us to determine whether this structure is still relevant in a highly parallel context.

%Correctness
%We first argue that the data structure is correct, even under concurrent
%operations. The most common way of showing that an algorithm
%implements a linearizable object is to show that in every

%execution there exists a total ordering of the operations with the
%following properties: (1) the ordering is consistent with the desired
%insert/search semantics, and (2) if one operation completes before
%another begins, then the first operation precedes the second in the
%ordering. Linearizability follows due to a straightforward extension
%of Lemmas 13.10 and 13.16 in [22].
